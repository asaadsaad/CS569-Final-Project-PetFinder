# CS569 - Final Project - PetFinder API
Create an Angular application to browse the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/).
  
For users to be able to use the application they must log in first, which comes in the form of entering a **valid Petfinder API key**.
  
After they log in successfully, a `BreedService` will fetch the list of "Dog" breeds and persist it in the state + `localStorage`, to be used in the future without re-fetching the breeds.
  
The main navigation displays two features: `Search`, and `Bookmarks`. 

### Search Component
A search form will be displayed to search by the following fields:
* `name` (input)
* `type` (hidden field, set to "Dog")
* `breed` (multiple values checkboxes, values read from your BreedService)
* `size`(multiple values checkboxes: small, medium, large, xlarge)
* `gender` (multiple values checkboxes: male, female, unknown)
* `status` (multiple values checkboxes: adoptable, adopted, found)
* `house_trained` (radiobox true/false)
* `location` (read the user location and allow users to enter a new location)
* `distance` (number between 100 and 500)
The search results will be displayed in pages of 20 items per page (allow pagination). 
  
### Dog Details Component
When a Dog is clicked use the `Get Animal` API to display the full details and pictures of the animal. 
* Add a button to add/remove the animal to/from a bookmarks list. A `BookmarkService` will be used to persist the user's bookmarks. 
  
### Bookmarks Component
Display the full list of bookmarks and allow the user to browse to the dog details page.

### Application specifications and requirements
Your project must use the following:  
* State properties in all components and services should be declared as `Signals`.
* The app module has the login logic. Create a featured lazy-loaded module for the rest of the features.
* The project must have a proper UI that complies with the web standards.
* A daily push is required to track your code progress and measure your performance. 

## Final Evaluation 
The submission deadline is on Friday at 9:00 PM. I will meet with you on Saturday at 10:00 AM and evaluate the final project code.  

Good luck, and happy coding!
